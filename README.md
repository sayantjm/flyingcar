## Background 
The Aeroplane class already defines a method called "fly" and has an implementation for it.
The Car class already has an implementation for "drive".
   
## The problem  
Redesign the classes so that we can have a flying car that can both drive and fly and so that we can re-use the same "fly" and "drive" implementations that have already been defined. i.e.

The FlyingCar should drive exactly like a Car drives, without copy-and-pasting the drive method.

## Solution
Used the Strategy Design Pattern
